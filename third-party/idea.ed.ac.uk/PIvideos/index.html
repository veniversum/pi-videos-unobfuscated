<title>Bradley-Terry ranking of PI Videos</title>
<body>
<h1>PI videos 2017</h1>
<p>This page is under development it gives visualisations of the
rankings of PI videos derived from the raw peer ranking data, using a modified Bradley-Terry model.
</p>
<p>Each dot represents a video. Click on a dot to see the relevant
homepage presentation of the video in the iframe (the inclusion of
this content in this page is under development and will be
will be improved). The vertical positions of each dot represents (on a
log scale) the
coefficient
for this video in a Bradley-Terry-Zermelo choice model. For further
details of the model, see below.</p>
<p>Videos were peer-ranked according to three criteria: relevance,
content, presentation. The check boxes allow you to select any subset
of these. The dots move vertically towards a maximum likelihood model
given the selected peer rankings. A further checkbox
allows you to stop (and restart) the simulation.

distribution is a generative model for a set of binary rankings, first
introduced by Zermelo in 1929. In this model, the odds that
individuals \(i,j\) are ranked \(i\succ j\) are given by
\(\gamma_i/\gamma_j\). Equivalently, \(P(i\succ j) =
\frac{\gamma_i}{\gamma_i+\gamma_j}\).  </p>
<p>This work was extended
by Luce to study rankings. For example, if we take three individuals,
\(i,j,k\) then the probability of the ranking \(i\succ j\succ k\) is
given by \[ P(i\succ j\succ k) = \frac{\gamma_i}{(\gamma_i+\gamma_j+
\gamma_k)}\cdot\frac{\gamma_j}{(\gamma_i+\gamma_j)}\quad\text{and,
more generally,}\quad P(x_1\succ x_2\succ\ldots\succ x_{n-1}\succ x_n)
=\prod_{k\lt n}\frac{\gamma_k}{\sum_{i=k}^n\gamma_i},\quad\text{where
$\gamma_i$ is the strength of $x_i$,}\] gives the
probability of a given ranking of \(n\) individuals.  </p> <p>Here,
the individuals are videos, and we have a sample of partial rankings
based on three separate criteria: relevance, presentation, and
content. We assume that these rankings are drawn from a distribution
based on Bradley-Terry
parameters.</p> <p> In total, we have \(132\) videos and \(119\times 3\)
rankings. Each marker is given a set of nine videos. These sets are
designed to give a multiple cover of the collection of videos, with minimal
intersections (a nine-fold cover by design, but a few
markers failed to deliver). For each criterion this set is ranked on triage scale, on
which the videos are classed as below average (Red), average (Amber),
or above average (Green). Markers are required to give a ranking: at
least three videos must be ranked Red and at least three Green.</p>

<p>Our distribution includes five factors. \[ P(G\succ A\succ R)\sim
\left(\frac{\mathcal{G}}{\mathcal{G+A+R}}\right)^{\lvert
G\rvert}\cdot\left(\frac{\mathcal{A}}{\mathcal{A+R}}\right)^{\lvert
A\rvert}\cdot \mathcal{G}^{\star}\cdot \mathcal{A}^{\star}\cdot \mathcal{R}^{\star},\\
\text{ where,
}\quad\mathcal{G}^{\lvert G\rvert} = \prod_{g\in G}{\gamma_g}\quad \mathcal{A}^{\lvert A\rvert} = \prod_{a\in
A}{\gamma_a}\quad \mathcal{R}^{\lvert R\rvert} = \prod_{r\in
R}{\gamma_r},\\
\mathcal{G}^{\star} = \prod_{g\in
G}\frac{{(\gamma_g\cdot \mathcal{G})^{1/2}}}{(\gamma_g + \mathcal{G})}\quad
\mathcal{A}^{\star} = \frac{\mathcal{A}^{\lvert A\rvert}}{\prod_{a\in
A} (\gamma_a + \mathcal{A})}\quad \mathcal{R}^{\star} = \prod_{r\in
R}\frac{\mathcal{R}}{ (\gamma_r + \mathcal{R})}.\]
<!-- In this model, given a set of videos and the sizes \(n\) -->
<!-- and \(m\) of the sets \(G, A\), that the likelihoods of choosing \(G\) -->
<!-- as the top \(n\), and then \(A\) as the top -->
<!-- \(m\) from those remaining, are proportional to the total weights of these -->
<!-- subsets, relative to the total weight of the set from which they are -->
<!-- drawn. -->
<!-- If \(\mathcal{A}\) is empty we omit the second factor. We do not model the choice -->
<!-- of the numbers \(n, m\). -->
The first two factors model the ranking as attributing the (geometric) mean strength
of the members to each set, and then making judgements that 
\(g\in G\) dominates both \(\mathcal{A}\) and  \(\mathcal{R}\), using
this mean strength for each comparison, and similarly,
that each \(a\in A\) dominates \(\mathcal{R}\), based on these mean strengths.
</p>
<p>The remaining factors express the cohesion of each chosen set of
videos. For each set \(X\in \{R, A, G\}\), they correspond to adding
an 'observation' that ranks  \(x\in X\) both above and below a
hypothetical phantom video endowed with the mean strength,
\(\mathcal{X}\). We show these in three equivalent forms; the first
shows this as the square root of a product of probabilities, the final form is more
convenient for the calculations below.</p>
<p>
The log-likelihood \(\ell(G\succ A\succ R)\) is given by
\[\begin{aligned} \ell(G\succ A\succ R) &=  \lvert G\rvert\left(\ln(\mathcal{G}) -
\ln(\mathcal{G+A+R})\right)  + \lvert A\rvert\left(\ln(\mathcal{A})
-\ln(\mathcal{A+R})\right)\\
&+\sum_{g\in G}\left(\ln(\mathcal{G})-\ln(\gamma_g+\mathcal{G})\right) + \sum_{a\in A}\left(\ln(\mathcal{A})-\ln(\gamma_a+\mathcal{A})\right) + \sum_{r\in R}\left(\ln(\mathcal{R})-\ln(\gamma_r+\mathcal{R})\right)
\end{aligned}\]

\[\begin{align*}\frac{\partial\ell(G\succ A\succ R)}{\partial
\gamma_g}&=\frac{\mathcal{G}}{\gamma_g}\cdot
\left(\frac{2}{\mathcal{G}}
-\frac{1}{\mathcal{(G+A+R)}}-\frac{1}{\lvert G\rvert}\sum_{x\in G}\frac{1}{(\mathcal{G} + \gamma_{x})}\right) - \frac{1}{\mathcal{G}+\gamma_g}\\
\frac{\partial\ell(G\succ A\succ R)}{\partial
\gamma_a}
&=\frac{\mathcal{A}}{\gamma_a}\cdot\left(\frac{2}{\mathcal{A}}
-\frac{\lvert G\rvert}{\lvert
A\rvert\mathcal{(G+A+R)}}-\frac{1}{(\mathcal{A+R})}-\frac{1}{\lvert
A\rvert}\sum_{y\in A}\frac{1}{(\mathcal{A} + \gamma_{y})}\right) - \frac{1}{\mathcal{A}+\gamma_a}\\
\frac{\partial\ell(G\succ A\succ R)}{\partial \gamma_r}&=
\frac{\mathcal{R}}{\gamma_r}\cdot\left(\frac{1}{\mathcal{R}}-\frac{\lvert G\rvert}{\lvert R\rvert\mathcal{(G+A+R)}} -
\frac{\lvert A\rvert}{\lvert R\rvert\mathcal{(A+R)}}-\frac{1}{\lvert R\rvert}\sum_{z\in R}\frac{1}{(\mathcal{R} + \gamma_{z})}\right) - \frac{1}{\mathcal{R}+\gamma_r}
\end{align*}\]
<p>Following Zermelo, we use a maximum likelihood
approach to assign the <i>strength</i> parameters \(\gamma_i\), for
each individual, \(i\). 
</p>
<p>In the animation above, each node represents one video. The
vertical position of each node represents the strength parameter for that
video (on a log scale, base 2, so that each unit on the vertical scale
represents  doubling of odds). The origin represents the geometric
average strngth.</p>
<p>The derivatives are applied as forces, which act on the nodes to
increase the log likelihood of the model.  These forces are simulated
to implement a search for maximum likelihood values of the parameters,
given all the rankings. A positive force acts to move the node up; a
negative force acts downwards.  </p> <p>If we only included the first
two factors in our model,
gradient ascent would make \(\gamma_r\) tend to zero, for any video \(r\)
that is always ranked \(R\). 
Adding the cohesion factors prevents overfitting for videos \(r\) with no
positive, or no negative scores. The energy shown as part of the simulation is
the negative log likelihood duer to the first two factors model. It does not include the
energy of the phantom rankings used to regularise the model, so you
may see an increase in energy when these effects dominate. At this
point you can stop the simulation.</p>
<p>You
can click on any node to see the comparisons that rank it higher or
lower than other videos. These comparisons are represented by arrows;
the arrow goes from the higher-ranked video to the lower-ranked.
higher-ranked video.  <i>For the moment only the rankings for
presentation are shown in this way,</i> but all three criteria may be
used, individually or in combination to drive the simulation. To
replace the links click on another node; to remove them click on
thebackground. </p> <p>You can drag nodes and release them to see how
the gradient ascent returns them to their proper position. Hovering
over a node shows an anonymised identifier
associated with the video. Soon you will be able to click to see
further metadata and watch the video.  </p>
